All About Prabhu: The Master Dataset
Personal Summary
My name is Prabhu Charan. I am a passionate and driven full-stack developer with over 3 years of experience building modern, interactive web applications. My core expertise lies in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), TypeScript, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like 3D graphics with Three.js and generative AI with Python. I have successfully delivered over 50 projects, ranging from e-commerce platforms to sophisticated AI-powered tools. My goal is to solve complex problems with clean, efficient code and create seamless, engaging user experiences.

Childhood & Early Education (2004 - 2020)
I was born on June 10, 2004, in the village of Shakapuram, within the Nidamanoor mandal of Nalgonda district, Telangana, India. My birth name was Rahul Teja, but as my family is Christian, my name was later changed to Prabhu Charan to reflect our faith.

My parents, Elisha and Padma, were quite strict during my childhood. While they controlled my playtime and other activities, their guidance shaped me into a disciplined and good person. My closest childhood friends were my playful "kodals" (a term of endearment for my female cousins/relatives): the elder one Shinny, who is quiet and emotional; Reenu (whom I nicknamed "Chotu"), who is super friendly, energetic, and charming; and the younger one, Cherry, who is calm and softly spoken.

I completed my early schooling (Nursery to 5th class) in various private schools in my local mandal, including Little Angels High School, Krishnaveni Concept School, and Rebeccaa Concept School (2006 - 2015).

A significant change occurred when I secured a seat in the Telangana State Model School with a score of 47. I studied there from 6th to 10th class (2015 - 2020). The new school environment was initially lonely, but I soon became close friends with Harivardhan, an energetic and charming boy. We shared everything, but he eventually left his studies. My older brother, who is four years my senior, always encouraged me to befriend the top students and introduced me to my classmate, Varun Tej.

In 7th class, Varun and I, along with Yogeshwar, Laxman, and Vamshi, formed a friends' group. We were a friendly and mischievous bunch, but Varun and I were also the toppers in our group.

My interest in technology began to take physical form during this time. In 7th class, I built a biped robot that walked using a crankshaft and motor, a video of which was uploaded to YouTube by my maths teacher. In 8th class, I built several electronics projects, including a water level alarm for tanks and smart lights that could sync to music. In 9th class, I focused completely on my studies.

It was also in 9th class that I first got access to a computer lab, thanks to my teacher Padmavathi Ma'am. I started with the Paint application and quickly became fascinated with computers. My interest in drawing also flourished in 10th class, where I created pencil drawings of historical figures like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Gautama Buddha, which were displayed in the Principal's office, the staff room, and the library.

In 10th class, Varun and I were focused on the SSC board exams, dreaming of getting into IIIT Basara. We challenged ourselves by studying math chapters from the end of the textbook, often completing them before they were taught in class. However, the final exams were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I was awarded a 10 CGPA but was ineligible for IIIT Basara due to their age criteria, which was a significant disappointment.

Higher Education (2020 - Present)
After 10th class, I appeared for the POLYCET entrance exam and secured a rank of 9525. I got a seat in the Computer Science branch at Government Polytechnic College, Nalgonda. The transition was challenging; I failed Mathematics in my first semester and C language in my second semester, partly due to illness. This was a turning point. After a stern talk from my brother, I became determined to excel. I taught myself Python to build a strong programming foundation, which helped me clear all my backlogs. My academic performance improved steadily, and I scored a 9.03 GPA in my 5th semester, even after waking up just five minutes before an exam. I graduated with an overall CGPA of 8.7.

During my second year of polytechnic, I made two wonderful friends, Mounika and Pavani, who became my closest companions.

After polytechnic, I went to Saimedha Institute in Koti, Hyderabad, for ECET coaching to get into a B.Tech program. This was my first time in Hyderabad, a city I had only dreamed of. I secured a seat in the AIDS (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science) branch at CBIT (Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology) through the ECET exam, gaining direct entry into the second year.

This is where I reunited with my school friend, Varun, who was studying ECE at the same college. I was welcomed into his friend group, which included Alekhya, Akanksha, Nandini, Bhavya, Pawan Kalyan, Khashyap, Mahender, and Karthik. Khashyap became my roommate and close friend. Alekhya became my best female friend in college; she was a hugely positive influence in my life, encouraging me to experience new things like going to movie theaters and visiting Charminar for the first time. In my own class, Siddharth and Sai Santhosh are my closest friends.

My B.Tech journey also had its academic challenges. I had a backlog in the "Indian Constitution" subject in my 3rd semester (GPA 7.6) and two backlogs in "DSA" and "Machine Learning" in my 4th semester (GPA 6.7), partly due to health issues that led to hospitalization. However, I cleared them all promptly. My 5th-semester GPA was 8.1 with no backlogs. I am currently on track to complete my 4th and final year in June 2026.
